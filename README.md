## ⚠️ Browser Security Warning

This project is hosted via **GitHub Pages** at:

🌐 [https://mrinal-daharia.github.io/netflix-clone/](https://mrinal-daharia.github.io/netflix-clone/)

> ⚠️ **Note:** All assets (fonts, images, etc.) are loaded securely via `https://`.  
> However, some browsers may still show a **"Not Secure"** or **"Deceptive Site"** warning.  
> This often happens due to GitHub Pages' automatic SSL certificates not being fully recognized immediately for new or custom-linked repositories. The content itself is safe.
